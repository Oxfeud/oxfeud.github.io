	<h3>Nomenclature</h3>
	<p>Since the page became popular, we have adopted a set of words for specific purposes. These are as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>When referring to the page and its administration as a whole, we adopt the pronoun <i>we</i>.</li>
		<li>When referring to the individual writing the text specifically, we adopt the pronoun <i>I</i>. This is typically reserved for comments and personal requests.</li>
		<li>Text submitted through <a href="https://www.crush.ninja/pages/oxfeud/">CrushNinja</a> or direct message for the purposes of publication is referred as a <i>submission</i>. These are authored by others.</li>
		<li>Once the submission is publicised, the article viewable by the public itself is a <i>post</i>. These are effectively authored by us, and may include edits deviating from the submission itself.</li>
		<li>The vast majority of submissions refer to another entity, named a <i>target</i>.</li>
		<li>The anonymous individual(s) who wrote a submission is/are referred to as the <i>author</i>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There is no intended implication regarding any of these word choices; they merely seemed the most practical when we started using language consistently.</p>
	<h3>Endorsement</h3>
	<p>Neither <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oxfeud">Oxfeud</a> nor its adminstration endorse any material published on the page.</p>
	<p>We recieve many submissions of many different kinds. Some of these align with our personal viewpoints; some do not. The same goes for alignment with the viewpoint of so-called <i>general public</i>. We are committed to impartiality and, provided it does not violate our rules, we feel an obligation to publish it.</p>
	<h3>Anonymity</h3>
	<p>The first rule implemented was that of anonymity. All submissions' authors are posted anonymously, to the extent that we typically adjust submissions in case they are signed-off with name. Moreover, we believe that submissions' targets should remain anonymous to the general public; there would be no content at all if there were no identifying information about the target.</p>
