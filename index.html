	<p>We recieve many submissions of many different kinds. Some of these align with our personal viewpoints, some do not. The same goes for alignment with the viewpoint of so-called <i>general public</i>. We are committed to impartiality and, provided it does not violate our rules, we feel an obligation to publish it.</p>
