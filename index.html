	<h3>Nomenclature</h3>
	<p>Since the page became popular, we have adopted a set of words for specific purposes. These are as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>When referring to the page and its administration as a whole, we adopt the pronoun <i>we</i>.</li>
		<li>When referring to the individual writing the text specifically, we adopt the pronoun <i>I</i>. This is typically reserved for comments and personal requests.</li>
		<li>Text submitted through <a href="https://www.crush.ninja/pages/oxfeud/">CrushNinja</a> or direct message for the purposes of publication is referred as a <i>submission</i>. These are authored by others.</li>
		<li>Once the submission is publicised, the article viewable by the public itself is a <i>post</i>. These are effectively authored by us, and may include edits deviating from the submission itself.</li>
		<li>The vast majority of submissions refer to another entity, named a <i>target</i>.</li>
		<li>The anonymous individual(s) who wrote a submission is/are referred to as the <i>author</i>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>There is no intended implication regarding any of these word choices; they merely seemed the most practical when we started using language consistently.</p>
	<br />
	<h3>Endorsement</h3>
	<p>Neither <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oxfeud">Oxfeud</a> nor its adminstration endorse any material published on the page.</p>
	<p>We recieve many submissions of many different kinds. Some of these align with our personal viewpoints; some do not. The same goes for alignment with the viewpoint of so-called <i>general public</i>. We are committed to impartiality and, provided it does not violate our rules, we feel an obligation to publish it. We believe that no idea is above criticism or skepticism, and this extends to matters that some may consider sensitive or close-to-heart. Although we must operate within the confines of U.K. law, we will refuse to stifle a voice simply because it is disagreeable.</p>
	<br />
	<h3>Anonymity</h3>
	<p>The first rule implemented was that of anonymity. All submissions' authors are posted anonymously, to the extent that we typically adjust submissions in case they are signed-off with name. Moreover, we believe that submissions' targets should remain anonymous to the general public; there would be no content at all if there were no identifying information about the target.</p>

	<br />
	<h3>Rules and moderation</h3>
	<p>There are presently 3 rules being enforced:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>No attacks of character;</li>
		<li>Anonymity of the target;</li>
		<li>No politics.</li>
	</ol>
	<p><i>Rules 1</i> and <i>2</i> were first created near the inception of the page. The former exists as an initial defence against the page devolving into insults both petty and otherwise, and preventing hate speech for legal purposes. The latter is so to formalise the page's purpose. Lastly, <i>Rule 3</i> was created following the announcement of the 8th June 2017 U.K. general elections: the administration determined that cross-party feuding would envelop the page's content, which lead to the creation of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Oxfeud2PB/">Oxfeud 2: Political Boogaloo</a>. The specifics of the rules and their implementation is described in greater detail below.</p>
	<h4>Enforcement</h4>
	<p>When we recieve a submission, we make a judgement whether it follows our rules. To determine if it follows <i>Rule 1</i> when the target is a specific person, we look for reference to a voluntary action. If we are unable to find fault in the target without reliance upon the author's assessment of a subjective characteristic, we typically deem it unsuitable. As for <i>Rule 2</i>, we consider the demographic that the post refers to. If it is suitably large, then we consider it anonymous and accept it. If the submission refers to a political stance without reference to a single person/organisation's actions, then we deem it in violation of <i>Rule 3</i> and either delete the submission or move it to Oxfeud 2.</p>
	<p>Of course, the administration is comprised of humans who are inherently fallible. Although we strive to be fair and consistent arbiters, sometimes a rogue submission is published. In this case, when we are made aware of it and re-assess it as in violation of our rules, we will delete the post without warning.</p>
	<p>At times, the submission is valid, save for a certain term of phrase. In this case, we will edit out the compromising portion rather than delete the full submission. This practice is also carried out on unpublished submissions if we are able to catch it in time.</p>
	<h4>No attacks of character</h4>
	<br />
	<h3>Content warnings</h3>
	<p>We do not include content warnings on our posts. If you are particularly sensitive to a specific topic, we suggest you unlike the page, or block it. Oxford is a city where much goes on; we cannot foresee which subjects will and will not be discussed in the future.</p>
	<br />
	<h3>Identity of the administration</h3>
	<p>Although each member of the administration is currently a matriculated student at the <a href="http://ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>, we do not and will not divulge any specifics of our identities.</p>
	<br />
	<h3>Relationship with other pages</h3>
	<p>Besides <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oxfeud">Oxfeud</a>, we also manage <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Oxfeud2PB/">Oxfeud 2: Political Boogaloo</a>, to cater for the political (pseudo-)discussion that once dominated the main page itself.</p>
	<p>We maintain a friendly relationship with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theoxlove/">Oxlove</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Oxfess-117373032144331/">Oxfess</a>, and have exchanged contact details privately. We share no part in their administration, nor they in ours. We are also unrelated to the other popular Oxford-related pages, e.g. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oxmemes/">Oxmeme</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/memeingspires/">The Memeing Spires of Oxford</a>.</p>
